        <p>Aristana has aspired to be a doctor from a young age, but through professors at Tufts University became engaged with computer science. Her goal is to be able to combine computer science and medicine in a way that can create new and better tools for patients and physicians. Aristana has always loved medicine, and always loved technology, so finding the intersection of the two just seemed natural to her. When she is not busy with school work, Aristana enjoys hiking, knitting, and reading scientific papers. </p>
